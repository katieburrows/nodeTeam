# nodeTeam

using the CLI the user is able to add players to a roster.  After the first three players are added the subsequent players are added to the bench/reserves.  The user is then able to play their team members against the random players who's HP are generated by the computer.  You will win or lose.  After the game is over you can play another round and switch out your players or keep them the same and go another round!
